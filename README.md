# 3D Card Flip Project

This project demonstrates a **3D card flip animation** using **HTML** and **CSS**. When you hover over the card, it flips in 3D space, revealing the back side. It uses `rotate3d` to create a more dynamic and engaging rotation effect.

## ✨ Features

* Pure HTML and CSS — no JavaScript required.
* 3D flip effect using `transform-style: preserve-3d` and `rotate3d`.
* Smooth transitions with `ease-in-out`.
* Responsive positioning at the center of the viewport.
* Stylish card with shadows and rounded corners.

## 🧱 Project Structure

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="card">
        <div class="front">Front :)</div>
        <div class="back">Back :)</div>
    </div>
</div>
```

* `.container`: Centered wrapper that enables 3D perspective.
* `.card`: The main flipping element.
* `.front` and `.back`: Front and back faces of the card.

## 🎨 CSS Highlights

* **Perspective**: `perspective: 600px;` applied to `.container` creates the 3D space.
* **3D Flip**: On hover, the `.card` is transformed with:

  ```css
  transform: rotate3d(1, 1, 1, 180deg);
  ```
* **Visibility Handling**: `backface-visibility: hidden;` ensures the back side doesn't show through the front.
* **Smooth Animation**: Transition applied on the card for a fluid rotation.

## 📸 Preview

When hovered:

* **Front side** (red) flips out.
* **Back side** (yellow) flips in.

## 🛠️ Browser Support

This project works on all modern browsers that support 3D CSS transformations.

## 🧪 Use Case

Ideal for:

* Interactive portfolio elements
* Flash cards or quizzes
* UI components for modern web apps
